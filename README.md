# Jpeg-Baseline-Image-Manipulation

Part of my Data Compression class was to write a program that change the size of a jpeg image.

In the header of a jpeg image we can find the width and height of the image. by changing the width accordingly to the height, jpeg sample blocks are shifted up or down.

Get a jpeg baseline image, run the program and get some interesting results:)

This is a link to a website that check if a jpeg image is of baseline type: https://www.imgonline.com.ua/eng/progressive-or-baseline-jpeg.php
